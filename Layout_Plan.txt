ball 
ball moves down from middle of screen and moves in a line depending on where the paddle is
ball will bounce around and move based on the direction ( reversing direction)
ball will hit paddle and bounce upwards

player has 3 lives
player looses 1 life if ball goes below a y limit
game will end and show End Screen if lives = 0

bricks
bricks are rectangles that will be for points
bricks will have different colors that determine how many times it needs to be hit 
bricks will be destroyed if hit limit is reached
bricks add points for each hit and a lump sum of points for each destroyed brick

after all bricks are destroyed a new group of bricks will appear ( i think having different brick layouts in a hashmap and have them change randomly?)

score is shown at the end
